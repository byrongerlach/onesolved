Here is a list of files you can clean before builds for C++:

I'm not only a C# moderator but also a C++ user :} The ipch directory and the many, many new files generated by the compiler can be safely deleted. In fact they should be deleted (and probably are) for clean builds. I teach a C++ college class myself and here is what I require my students to do.
1.In the solution folder delete all bin, obj, ipch, debug and release directories.
2.Delete any .suo files
3.Delete any .user files
4.Delete any .ncb files
5.Delete any .sbr files
6.Delete any .*log files (for VS 2010)
I've had no issues following the given steps.

Update:
raphinesse has also linked to a question which states that the .SDF file can be removed safely as well.
